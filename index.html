            <h1>Importance of Education</h1>
            <p>Education is an important part of human life. Education gives meaning to our life as it enables the
                growth
                and development of our mind and intellect. An educated society is an enlightened and empowered one. Such
                a
                society can make well-informed choices in its social, political and economic welfare. Education,
                therefore,
                ensures social justice, economic strength and political freedom. In the absence of education society
                remains
                backward.</p>
            <p>Education must be given top priority by every country. All children and youth of a country must have
                access
                to education. Through universal access to education, society can make progress swiftly and peacefully.
            </p>
            <p>Education is the backbone of a socially, economically and politically just and strong society. Through
                education social disparities and maladies can be wiped out to a great extent. Injustice against women,
                the
                poor, the minorities and the backward can be done away with if all children and youth are afforded
                education. Education serves to enlighten people about their rights and duties to society and the nation.
                Education can thus help in transforming people individually, and through a cumulative effect, the
                society
